# Fresh_Air_Calculation
A python based calculation tool for creating input sheet for heat-load &amp; cooling load calucaltion of buildings. The features of this tool are follows:
1. Fresh air requirement in building/room can be calculated based on pressurization requirement, Air change per hour(ACPH), ASHRAE 62.1, Local standard(flow rate per area or flow rate per person)
2. The input requirement for heat load calculation is furnished in an excel file.
3. Calculation of roof, false ceiling and flooring area is performed based on coefficients which are attributes of the dimesnion of the room.
4. a directory of door and windows can be built to calculate leakage through them and infilteration.
